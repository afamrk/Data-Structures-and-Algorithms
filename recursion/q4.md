# Question
Find all permutations of a string in Python
# Answer
### Python
```python
def permute(s):
    out = []
    
    # Base Case
    if len(s) == 1:
        out = [s]
        
    else:
        
        # For every letter in string
        for i, let in enumerate(s):
            
            # For every permutation resulting from Step 2 and 3 described above
            for perm in permute(s[:i] + s[i+1:]):
                
                # Add it to output
                out += [let + perm]

    return out
```

```python
def permutations(remaining, candidate='', l = None):

    if l is None:
        l = []

    if len(remaining) == 0:
        l.append(candidate)

    for i in range(len(remaining)):
        newCandidate = candidate + remaining[i]
        newRemaining = remaining[0:i] + remaining[i + 1:]

        permutations(newRemaining, newCandidate, l)

    return l
```
