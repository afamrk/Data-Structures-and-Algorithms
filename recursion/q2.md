# Question
Create a function called word_split() which takes in a string phrase and a set list_of_words. The function will then determine if it is possible to split the string in a way in which words can be made from the list of words. You can assume the phrase will only contain words found in the dictionary if it is completely splittable.

word_split('themanran',['the','ran','man']) 
> output => ['the', 'man', 'ran']

word_split('ilovedogsJohn',['i','am','a','dogs','lover','love','John']) 
> output => ['i', 'love', 'dogs', 'John']

word_split('themanran',['the','aran','man']) 
> output => []
# Answer
### Python
```python
def word_split(string, words, output=None):
    # Checks to see if any output has been initiated.
    # If you default output=[], it would be overwritten for every recursion!
    if(output is None):
        output = []
    
    if(len(string) == 0):
        return output
    
    for word in words:
        word_len = len(word)
        # If the current phrase begins with the word, we have a split point!
        if(string[0:word_len] == word):
                  output.append(word)
                  # Recursively call the split function on the remaining portion of the phrase--- phrase[len(word):]
                  # Remember to pass along the output and list of words
                  return word_split(string[word_len:], words, output)
    return []
```

### without recursion
```python
def word_split(string, words):
    word = ''
    l = []
    for letter in string:
        word = word + letter
        if word in words:
            l.append(word)
            word = ''
    if word:
        return []
    return l
```

### testing

```python
def check(func):
    assert func('themanran',['the','ran','man']) == ['the', 'man', 'ran']
    assert func('ilovedogsJohn',['i','am','a','dogs','lover','love','John']) == ['i', 'love', 'dogs', 'John']
    assert func('themanran',['the','aran','man']) == []
    assert func('theonetwothree',['the','one','two']) == []
    assert func('theonetwothree',['the','one','two']) != ['the','one','two']
    print('ALL TESTS PASSED')

check(word_split)

```
