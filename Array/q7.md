# Question
Maximum sum such that no two elements are adjacent
Input: [5, 5, 10, 100, 10, 5]
Output: 110
Explanation: Pick the subsequence {5, 100, 5}.
The sum is 110 and no two elements are adjacent. This is the highest possible sum.

Input: [3, 2, 7, 10]
Output: 13
Explanation: The subsequence is {3, 10}. This gives sum = 13.
This is the highest possible sum of a subsequence following the given criteria

Input: [3, 2, 5, 10, 7]
Output: 15
Explanation: Pick the subsequence {3, 5, 7}. The sum is 15.
# Answer
### method 1
```python
def largest_sum1(arr):
    inc = 0
    exc = 0

    for value in arr:

        new_exc = max(inc, exc)

        inc = exc + value
        exc = new_exc

    return max(inc,exc)
```

### method 2
```python
def largest_sum(arr, n=0):
    if n >= len(arr):
        return 0

    with_e = arr[n] + largest_sum(arr, n+2)
    without_e = largest_sum(arr, n+1)

    return max(with_e,without_e)
```

### method 3
```python
```
### testing

```python
def test(sol):
    assert sol([3, 2, 7, 10]) == 13
    assert sol([5, 5, 10, 100, 10, 5]) == 110
    assert sol([3, 2, 5, 10, 7]) == 15
    print("ALL TEST CASES PASSED")
```
