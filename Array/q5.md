# Question
Consider an array of non-negative integers. A second array is formed by shuffling the elements of the first array and deleting a random element. Given these two arrays, find which element is missing in the second array.

Here is an example input, the first array is shuffled and the number 5 is removed to construct the second array.

Input:

finder([1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[3,7,2,1,4,6])
Output:

5 is the missing number

# Answer
### method 1
```python
def finder(arr1, arr2):
    #better to use defaultdict in collection module
    seen = dict()

    for item in arr1:
        seen[item] = seen.get(item,0) + 1

    for item in arr2:
        if item in seen:
            seen[item] = seen.get(item,0) - 1
        else:
            return False

    return {k:v for k,v in seen.items() if v}
```

### method 2
```python
from collections import Counter
def finder(arr1, arr2):
    arr1_count = Counter(arr1)
    arr2_count = Counter(arr2)
    return arr1_count - arr2_count
```

### method 3
```python
def finder(arr1, arr2):
    result = 0
    for num in arr1+arr2:
        result ^= num
    return result
```
